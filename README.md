Validating whether Fandango has improved their movie rating system

Link to Jupyter Notebook: [notebook](Basics.ipynb)

My analysis shows that the average Fandango rating for popular movies has decreased slightly by 4.8% (from 4.08 in 2015 to 3.89 in 2016). This could indicate that Fandango has improved their rating system after data journalist Walt Hickey found strong evidence to suggest that their system was biased and dishonest.
